            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between GDP per capita (on a log scale) and life expectancy across various regions of the world. Each dot represents a country, with the size of the dots corresponding to the population size. The countries are grouped by continent, as indicated by different colors: Africa (blue), America (orange), Asia (red), Europe (green), and Oceania (light blue). The plot suggests that higher GDP per capita is generally associated with longer life expectancy, with regional variations evident. Data sources include the UN Population Prospects 2022 for life expectancy and the World Bank for GDP.

                This line graph illustrates the projected cumulative percentage change in population for several countries from 2020 to 2100. Countries like South Korea and Japan are expected to see significant population declines, while the UK and the US are projected to experience moderate population growth. Data source: UN.

                This horizontal bar chart displays the deviation from gender parity across various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The bars extending to the left represent countries where gender parity has not been achieved, with Pakistan showing the highest deviation. The bars extending to the right indicate countries with a slight positive deviation, where more progress has been made toward gender parity. Countries like the Philippines and Solomon Islands exhibit a positive deviation toward gender balance, while countries like Tajikistan and Maldives show significant gender inequality. The chart emphasizes the varying degrees of gender parity across the region.

                This stacked horizontal bar chart illustrates the amount of CO2 emissions (in kg) produced per kilogram of various types of food. The emissions are broken down by different stages of production and distribution: land use, farm activities, animal feed, processing, transport, retail, and packaging. The chart shows that beef (from both beef and dairy herds) and lamb & mutton generate the highest CO2 emissions, largely driven by land use and farm activities. On the other end, foods like peas, bananas, and maize have significantly lower emissions. The data source is "Our World in Data."

The data shows a steady increase in renewable electricity generation over time, with a significant acceleration in growth starting around 2005. By 2020, renewable generation reached close to 9,000 billion kilowatt-hours, reflecting a major global shift towards renewable energy sources. The source of this data is the U.S. Energy Information Administration (US EIA).
