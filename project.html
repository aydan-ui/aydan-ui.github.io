            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               This scatter plot depicts very interesting findings. Although it is very logical to conclude that higher-rated movies are also popular, the data counterfacts this assumption. High-rated movies mostly note relatively lower popularity score. Also, it can be observed that some very popular mocies are not so highly-rated. The movies popularity and ratings may not always coincide as perhaps the marketing budget, star power and many other factors can influence the outcomes.

               This pie chart demonstrates that the movie genres like Drama, Action, and Comedy have higher shares in the industry which means they appeal to the wider audience. However, there are some genres like Documentary and Western that they appealing to the niche audience in contrast. The existing polarity is a great opportunity for content creators to try underrepresented genres and attract the relevant audiences.

            <h3>Chart 4 | Popularity Trend for Selected Genres by Release Year </h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               This interactive line chart illustrates the trends by the release years in top 5 genres. It reveals that there was a sharp increase in 1999 perhaps due to the fact that in this year there were blockbuster releases including Avatar.  Similarly, Science Fiction saw significant inclines in 1997 and 2019 which is linked to computer-generated images and high profile releases. We can see increases in Animation trends in 2006 which are most likely affected by animated films and the popularity of streaming platforms. All the genres experience a significant spike in 2023 which can be associated with movies postponed to release not in 2020 and 2021 but in 2022 and 2023. Further analysis is needed. The trends in general are beneficial in terms of seeing how the technological advancements in the movie sector, blockbusters and evolving audience preferences over the time affect the popularity trends of genres.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               The "Adventure" genre is highlighted in orange for emphasising its dominant position being highest-voted one. "Science Fiction" and "Fantasy" are also popular genres recording above-average vote counts. In contrast, the less popular genres are "Horror" and "Romance". The first bar chart in this project indicated some romantic movies were among the most popular ones. One could assume it points about the success of genre as well. However, with this visualisation we can observe that a couple successful movies do not necessarily imply that overall performance of the genre is also high.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               This heatmap illustrates how many movies were released over the past three decades. The data is grouped by months and 5-year intervals. Higher number of movie releases are marked with darker shades of blue. The map shows that June-July is a peak period most probably because of summer holidays and more available time for audience to watch movies. December is also noted with the higher activity which can be explained by the holiday blockbusters. We can see the heat increasing in post-2010 period which can be associated with rising streaming platforms and lower production costs year by year. The technological advancements drives a sharp increase in movie production as we can see post 2000 period is marked with more movie releases.
