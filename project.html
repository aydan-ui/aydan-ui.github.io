    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>What drives audience preferences, and how have movie ratings evolved across genres over time? For making data-driven decisions and meeting the customers expectations, it is essential for the companies in the entertainment industry to understand the movie ratings and audience preferences including their change over time. This analysis, conducted based on the dataset about popular movies from TMDb, delves into key indicators including movie vote averages, genres, release years. This study can be helpful for producers, marketers and movie platforms in shaping their content strategies. Nowadays, the companies including Disney+ and Netflix are rising in popularity. Therefore, analysing genre-specific trends in movie industry can be beneficial to reveal genres performing high consistently, preferences of audience and crucial shifts in ratings for these type of companies in terms of improving the quality of streaming services. </p>
    </section>

   <section id="data">
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>This analysis is implemented based on two main datasets which offer a comprehensive view of audience preferences and trends in the movie industry:</p>
    <p>
        1. <strong>TMDb API Dataset:</strong>  
        I accessed this dataset via TMDb API. It is a highly reliable source for getting data about movies. Dataset contains important metrics related to key variables such as vote averages, popularity scores, genres, release dates etc. The data covers multiple decades that allows extensive view on audience preferences. With the help of this dataset, I could visualize the trends in movie industry based on key variables. API ensures the real-time updates as well. Therefore, it was beneficial in terms of analysing the current trends as well. I cleaned and prepared this dataset for the analysis utilising Pandas library. Also, for visualizing key trends I employed Altair. Loops were used to handle the large amounts of data. 
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <strong>Wikipedia Dataset for Academy Awards and Genres:</strong>  
        I used this data by employing the web scraping tool Beautiful Soup to get the data from Wikipedia. The dataset includes information about the Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film and its winners. Then I merged this data with the one from API to understand what is the share of genres among the award winners. In addition, I used GeoJson for mapping geographical patterns.

            <h3>Chart 1 | Top Genres Ranking Based on Top Movies </h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Let's look at the top genres based on top 10 movies. I fetched the data of popular movies from TMDb API, and parsed their genres. Afterwards, mapping genres with the names, I could get the most frequent genres based on their appearances in top movies list. The genres "Action" and "Adventure" are leading ones. This bar chart is a good background to see how genres are performing based on other key metrics.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               This scatter plot depicts very interesting findings. Although it is very logical to conclude that higher-rated movies are also popular, the data counterfacts this assumption. High-rated movies mostly note relatively lower popularity score. Also, some very popular movies are not so highly-rated. Further research is needed on what other variables affect the outcomes. The scatter plot is interactive showing some key metrics, as well as poster, when you hover over.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               This pie chart demonstrates that the movie genres like Drama, Action, and Comedy have higher shares in the industry which means they appeal to the wider audience. However, there are some genres like Documentary and Western that they appealing to the niche audience in contrast. The existing polarity is a great opportunity for content creators to try underrepresented genres and attract the relevant audiences.

            <h3>Chart 4 | Popularity Trend for Selected Genres by Release Year </h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               Popularity reflects audience engagement on TMDb, based on search frequency, page views, user interactions, and external mentions. This chart shows average popularity trends by release years for the top 5 genres. Notable spikes include 1999, likely due to blockbusters like Avatar, and Science Fiction surges in 1997 and 2019, tied to CGI advances and major releases. Animation trends rose in 2006 with popular films and streaming growth, while the 2023 spike reflects delayed releases from 2020–2021. These trends highlight the impact of technological advancements, blockbusters, and changing audience preferences on genre popularity.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               The "Adventure" genre is highlighted in orange for emphasising its dominant position being highest-voted one. "Science Fiction" and "Fantasy" are also popular genres recording above-average vote counts. In contrast, the less popular genres are "Horror" and "Romance". The results are almost similar to the first bar chart however, we can observe that the genres "War" and "Crime" with above average vote count are not among the genres of the top movies. Thus successful movies do not necessarily imply that overall performance of the genre is also high.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               This heatmap illustrates how many popular movies were released over the past three decades. The data is grouped by months and 5-year intervals. Higher number of movie releases are marked with darker shades of blue. The map shows that June-July is a peak period most probably because of summer holidays and more available time for audience to watch movies. December is also noted with the higher activity which can be explained by the holiday blockbusters. We can see the heat increasing in post-2010 period which can be associated with rising streaming platforms and lower production costs year by year. We can see post 2000 period is marked with more movie releases.

            This choropleth map illustrates how the Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film is distributed by country. The darker colors represent countries with more awards. The countries like Italy and France are the ones with a history of significant number of awards.

            <h3>Chart 8 | Most Common Genres in Award-Winning Films by Country</h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               I wanted to analyse if the previous analysis like genre distribution and vote ranking are applicable to the most award-winning genres as well. As we can observe, Drama genre is both award-winning and has more shares. However, it has below average votes compared to others.  Similarly, the genres Animation, Romance and Comedy are marked with below average votes despite being most award-winning genres in top 3 countries. In addition, the shares of Animation and Romance genres in movie industry are not as high as Comedy and Drama. Thus, it seems the vote ranking and shares are not correlated with awards. It seems the cultural storytelling traditions affect the prioritizing in award distribution as well.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>While working on the project, I faced with two main challenges. Firstly, the genres were IDs in API instead of human-readable names which was difficult to interpret. To tackle this, "genres_mapping" dictionary was manually created so that the genre names could be linked to the corresponding IDs. Secondly, the TMDb API had some limitations such as the number of movies being retrieved per request. It required pagination for larger datasets. To handle this issue, I implemented "loop" so that I can fetch multiple pages of data while balancing the usage limits of API and data requirements. This solution helped to get access to meaningful and structured data. </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This analysis reveals key insights into movie trends. It shows that popular movies are not always the ones with high rating as there can be other factors that impact it including marketing and star power which needs further research. The genres like Drama, Action and Comedy are dominating in the market whilst Documentary applies for niche audiences. Recommendations: Based on the analysis, it can be recommended that streaming companies should shape their contents by considering underrepresented genres. The analysis can be a foundation for the further research, such as exploring viewer demographics, understanding the impact of streaming platforms on voting rates, understanding what affects the award winning tendency or analysing the role of social media in driving movie popularity.</p>
