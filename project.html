            <h3>Chart 2 | Popularity vs Average Rating </h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
               This scatter plot depicts very interesting findings. Although it is very logical to conclude that higher-rated movies are also popular, the data counterfacts this assumption. High-rated movies mostly note relatively lower popularity score. Also, it can be observed that some very popular mocies are not so highly-rated. The movies popularity and ratings may not always coincide as perhaps the marketing budget, star power and many other factors can influence the outcomes.

               This pie chart demonstrates that the movie genres like Drama, Action, and Comedy have higher shares in the industry which means they appeal to the wider audience.
